# QOPTec: Quantum Optimization Benchmarking Platform

QOPTec is a Python library designed for benchmarking combinatorial optimization problems using quantum and hybrid solvers. This repository provides tools for reproducible experiments, extensibility, and ease of use.

## Features
- Benchmarking for canonical problems: Max-Cut, Knapsack, and TSP.
- Native execution of D-Wave quantum and hybrid solvers.
- Modular architecture for adding new solvers and problems.
- Export results in CSV/XLSX and generate plots.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QOPTec.git
cd QOPTec
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage Examples
Run QOPTec from the command line:
```bash
python main_qoptec.py -i 'INSTANCES' -s 'SOLVERS' -r 'REPETITIONS' -p 'PLOTS' -o 'OPTIMUMS'
```
Parameters:
- `-i`: Path to instance(s).
- `-s`: Solver(s) to use (bqm, cqm, nl, qpu).
- `-r`: Number of repetitions.
- `-p`: Enable plots (True/False).
- `-o`: List of optimum values.

An example that executes two hybrid algorithms of D-Wave through three instances of the MaxCut, running each of the five independent times could be
```bash
python main_qotec.py -i ../instances/mc/MaxCut_10.mc ../instances/mc/MaxCut_20.mc ../instances/mc/MaxCut_40.mc -s bqm cqm -r 5 -p False -p "[-17, -22, -33]"
```

---

## Reproducibility Guidelines
- All experiments can be replicated using the provided instances in `instances/`.
- Results generated by the platform are stored in `output/` as `.csv` and `.xlsx` files.
- Plots are generated automatically if `-p True` is set.

---

## Extension Points
Refer to Section 2.3 of the paper and the `src/` folder for details on adding:
- New solvers (extend `*_solvers.py`).
- New problems (create new solver files and register in `main_qoptec.py`).
